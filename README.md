Coding Bootcamp homework assignment using Node JS and added Inquirer & CTable to clean up the input & output.

This is the 'basic' version of the assignment that is the 'customer facing' aspect requiring input that interacts with a MySQL database.

I modeled the 'products' after the old drugWars game that i would play in math on my Ti-85 calculator. To be clear, i am not a drug dealer :)

Final submission included a video demonstration of the completed app. Code here for obvious reasons.
